Description: 
  This package contains functions, S4 classes, and a Shiny
  app for characterizing oscillations in ultrafast, time resolved 
  spectra. It currently includes functions to trim data, resample, 
  estimate power spectral density, calculate the continuous wavelet 
  transform, and visualualize spectroscopy data. Additionally, a 
  Shiny app provides a GUI to simplify the workflow.
